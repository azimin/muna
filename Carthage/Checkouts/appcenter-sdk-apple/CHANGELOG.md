___

## Version 2.0.1

Version 2.0.1 of the App Center SDK includes two new modules: Auth and Data. This version has a **breaking change**, it only supports Xcode 10.0.0+.

### App Center Auth

App Center Auth is a cloud-based identity management service that enables you to authenticate users and manage their identities. You can also leverage user identities in other App Center services. **iOS only, not available for macOS*.

### App Center Data

The App Center Data service provides functionality enabling developers to persist app data in the cloud in both online and offline scenarios. This enables you to store and manage both user-specific data as well as data shared between users and across platforms. **iOS only, not available for macOS*.

### App Center Crashes

* **[Feature]** After calling `[MSAuth signInWithCompletionHandler:]`, the next crashes are associated with an `accountId` corresponding to the signed in user. This is a different field than the `userId` set by `[MSAppCenter setUserId:]`. Calling `[MSAuth signOut]` stops the `accountId` association for the next crashes.
* **[Fix]** Print an error and return immediately when calling `[MSCrashes notifyWithUserConfirmation:]` with confirmation handlers not implemented.

### App Center Distribute

* **[Fix]** Starting the application with "Guided Access" enabled blocks the update flow since in-app update is not possible in this mode.

### App Center Push

* **[Feature]** After calling `[MSAuth signInWithCompletionHandler:]`, the push installation is associated to the signed in user with an `accountId` and can be pushed by using the `accountId` audience. This is a different field than the `userId` set by `[MSAppCenter setUserId:]`. The push installation is also updated on calling `[MSAuth signOut]` to stop the association.
* **[Fix]** Fix updating push installation when setting the user identifier via  `[MSAppCenter setUserId:]`.

___

## Version 1.14.0

### App Center

* **[Fix]** Fix a crash in case decrypting a value failed.

### App Center Analytics

* **[Feature]** Preparation work for a future change in transmission protocol and endpoint for Analytics data on macOS. There is no impact on your current workflow when using App Center.

### App Center Crashes

* **[Feature]** Add preview support for arm64e CPU architecture by using PLCrashReporter 1.2.3-rc1. PLCrashReporter 1.2.3-rc1 is a fork of the official repository and can be found at [https://github.com/Microsoft/PLCrashReporter](https://github.com/Microsoft/PLCrashReporter). It is maintained by the [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) team and based on PLCrashReporter 1.2.1 (commit [fda23306](https://github.com/Microsoft/PLCrashReporter/tree/fda233062b5586f5d01cc527af643168665226c0)) with additional fixes and changes.

* **[Fix]** Use standard SQL syntax to avoid affecting users with custom SQLite libraries.
* **[Fix]** Get database page size dynamically to support custom values.

### App Center Analytics

* **[Feature]** Add new trackEvent APIs that take priority (normal or critical) of event logs. Events tracked with critical flag will take precedence over all other logs except crash logs (when AppCenterCrashes is enabled), and only be dropped if storage is full and must make room for newer critical events or crashes logs.

### App Center Crashes

* **[Fix]** Do not force crash macOS application on uncaught exception. If you need this behavior you can set the special flag yourself:

    ```objc
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] registerDefaults:@{ @"NSApplicationCrashOnExceptions" : @YES }];
    ```

### App Center Push

* **[Fix]** Fix `push:didReceivePushNotification:` callback not triggered on notification tapped or received in foreground when a `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` is set.  If you have implemented this delegate please remove any call to the `MSPush#didReceiveRemoteNotification:` method as it's now handled by the new [User Notification Center Delegate Forwarder](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/sdk/push/ios).

___

## Version 1.10.1

___

## Version 1.2.0

* **[Fix]** Fix an issue not to delete pending logs after maximum retries.

### App Center Crashes

* **[Improvement]** Improve session tracking to get appropriate session information for crashes if an application also uses Analytics.

### App Center Push

* **[Fix]** Fix "Missing Push Notification Entitlement" warning message after uploading an application to TestFlight and publishing to App Store.
* **[Improvement]** In previous versions, it was required to add code to `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` callback in your application delegate if you or 3rd party libraries already implemented this callback. This is no longer necessary.
    This is a **breaking change** for some use cases because it required modifications in your code. Not changing your implementation might cause push notifications to be received twice.
    * If you don't see any implementation of `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` callback in your application delegate, you don't need to do anything, there is no breaking change for you.
    * If you want to keep automatic forwarding disabled, you also don't need to do anything.
    * If your application delegate contains implementation of `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler`, you need to remove the following code from your implementation of the callback. This is typically the case when you or your 3rd party libraries implement the callback.

      **Objective-C**
      ```objc
      BOOL result = [MSPush didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
      if (result) {
          completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);
      } else {
          completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData);
      }
      ```

      **Swift**
      ```swift
      let result: Bool = MSPush.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo)
      if result {
          completionHandler(.newData)
      }
      else {
          completionHandler(.noData)
      }
      ```

* **[Misc]** This release replaces the file-based persistence with a sqlite-based implementation. This change does not require any change from your side.

### MobileCenterCrashes

* [**Breaking**] The SDK now uses Mach Exception Handling by default. Use `[MSCrashes disableMachExceptionHandler]`/`MSCrashes.disableMachExceptionHandler()` to disable that behavior. `[MSCrashes enableMachExceptionHandler]`/`MSCrashes.enableMachExceptionHandler()` has been removed [#637](https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-ios/pull/637).

### MobileCenterPush

* **[Fix]** Fix a crash that was related to push notifications that were not intended for Mobile Center [#651](https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-ios/pull/651).

___

## Version 0.9.0

This version has **breaking changes**.
It contains improvements and new features.

### MobileCenter

* **[Feature]** Mobile Center now automatically forwards your application delegate's methods to the SDK. This is made possible by using method swizzling. It greatly improves the SDK integration but there is a possibility of conflicts with other third party libraries or the application delegate itself. In this case you may want to disable the Mobile Center application delegate forwarder by adding the `MobileCenterAppDelegateForwarderEnabled` tag to your Info.plist file and set it to `0`, doing so will disable application delegate forwarding for all Mobile Center services.

### MobileCenterCrashes

* **[Feature]** Crashes can now have attachments.

### MobileCenterDistribute

* **[Breaking]** The `openUrl:` API is renamed `openURL:` and returns `YES` if the URL is intended for Mobile Center Distribute and your application, `NO` otherwise.

* **[Breaking]** The application delegate `openURL` method(s) are now automatically forwarded to the SDK by default. The Mobile Center Distribute `openURL` can be removed from your application delegate's `openURL` method(s). If you decide to keep it then you will have to disable the Mobile Center application delegate forwarder.

### MobileCenterPush

* **[Breaking]** The application delegate `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken`, `didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError`, `didReceiveRemoteNotification` methods are now automatically forwarded to the SDK by default. The corresponding APIs from Mobile Center Push can be removed from your application delegate's methods. If you decide to keep them then you will have to disable the Mobile Center application delegate forwarder.
